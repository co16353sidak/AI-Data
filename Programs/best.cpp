/* knapsack3 serves as a function to solve our knapsack problem in which we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a profit, and we must determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given maximum weight W and the total value is as large as possible. Knapsack3 specifically uses the Branch & Bound Best-First search method to solve this problem. Knapsack3 uses a priority queue to organize nodes by their upper bounds, and calls for the help of our bound function to do so. knapsack3 uses an algorithm similar to Breadth-First Search, in which we have a root node v, and continue to explore neighboring nodes first, before continuing to further levels. Knapsack3 optimizes this method by identifying promising, unexplored nodes and simply expanding the one with the most promising/best bound. knapsack3 takes an integer for number of items n,  profit and weight arrays - assumed sorted, a maximum weight W greater than or equal to 0, and a maximum profit maxprofit. */
